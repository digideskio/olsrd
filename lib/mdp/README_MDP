Serval MDP Secure OLSR 0.1 implementation notes
(c)Open Technology Institute 2012
(c)Andreas Tonnesen 2004

This document contains information on how to
use the Serval MDP Secure OLSR plugin.
It does _not_ cover secure OLSR protocol issues.

Lines starting with '# ' indicates shell commands.

NOTES

  The plugin interface and olsrd output buffering was
  heavily rewritten for the 0.4.8 release. The plugin
  should work with this release - but has not been
  tested much.

COMPILING

  # make

INSTALLING

  To install:
  # make install

  This will run ldconfig to update the dynamic linker.
  It might take a while.

USAGE

  To make olsrd load the Serval MDP Secure OLSR plugin 
  add the following in the olsrd configuration file:

LoadPlugin "olsrd_mdp.so.0.1"
{
    PlParam     "sid"   "<Serval SID>"
    PlParam     "servalpath"   "<Serval Instance Path>"
}

  The plugin uses this public key of SID for signature
  generation and verification. For nodes to participate 
  in the OLSR routing domain they need to use the same SID.
